# recursion-image-grabber

Photographers upload their photos online and place captions on them. Some individuals may remember a caption for an image, but they don't know where the photos that are linked with those specific captions are located in piles of directories. This gui tool sorts the photos by their captions for an easy way of finding the photos. The tool recursively searches all directories witin a specific directory for all photos, and the photos are sorted into letter directories.
